# Todo Application Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the Todo Application, providing insights into its structure, components, and design decisions.

## System Overview

The Todo Application is built as a full-stack web application using Next.js, React, and MySQL. It follows a modern architecture with server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities, API routes for backend functionality, and a relational database for persistent storage.

## Architectural Principles

The application is designed following these key principles:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: UI is composed of reusable React components
2. **API-First Design**: All data operations go through well-defined API endpoints
3. **Domain-Driven Design**: Code organization reflects business domains
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with client-side features
5. **Security by Design**: Authentication, authorization, and data validation at multiple layers

## Core Technologies

### Frontend

- **Next.js**: React framework providing SSR, file-based routing, and API routes
- **React**: UI library for building component-based interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Material UI**: Component library for complex UI elements

### Backend

- **Next.js API Routes**: Serverless functions for backend logic
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication framework with multiple providers
- **Prisma**: ORM for database operations
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing library

### Database

- **MySQL**: Relational database system
- **Prisma Migrations**: Database schema version control

### Testing

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Testing utilities for React components
- **Mock Service Worker**: API mocking for testing

## Application Layers

The application follows a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React components and pages
2. **API Layer**: Next.js API routes for data operations
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic implementation
4. **Data Access Layer**: Prisma ORM for database operations
5. **Database Layer**: MySQL database

## Database Schema

The application's data model includes the following main entities:

- **User**: Application users with authentication details
- **Todo**: Todo items with attributes like activity, due date, priority
- **Category**: Custom categories for organizing todos
- **SharedTodo**: Mapping between todos and users they're shared with
- **Notification**: System notifications for users

Relationships:
- User ↔ Todo: One-to-many (a user has many todos)
- User ↔ Category: One-to-many (a user has many categories)
- Todo ↔ Category: Many-to-one (many todos can belong to one category)
- Todo ↔ User (via SharedTodo): Many-to-many (todos can be shared with multiple users)
- User ↔ Notification: One-to-many (a user receives many notifications)

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Flow

1. User signs up or logs in through NextAuth.js
2. NextAuth creates a JWT session token
3. Token is stored in an HTTP-only cookie
4. Token is validated on protected routes
5. Session information is accessible through `useSession` hook (client-side) or `getServerSession` (server-side)

### Authorization

- **Route-Level**: Middleware protects routes requiring authentication
- **API-Level**: Each API endpoint validates user session
- **Resource-Level**: Ownership and permissions checked for each resource operation

## Key Components

### User Authentication

- **SignInForm**: Email/password login form
- **SignUpForm**: Registration form for new users
- **AuthProvider**: Context provider for authentication state
- **OAuth Buttons**: Social login options

### Todo Management

- **TodoForm**: Create/edit todo items
- **TodoList**: Display and filter todos
- **TodoItem**: Individual todo representation
- **EnhancedTodoForm**: Advanced form with categories and priorities

### Categories

- **CategoryManagement**: CRUD interface for categories
- **CategorySelector**: Dropdown for selecting categories

### Dashboard

- **Dashboard**: Overview and statistics
- **MetricsCard**: Display key metrics
- **ChartComponents**: Visualizations for todo data

### Notifications

- **NotificationCenter**: Notification management UI
- **NotificationItem**: Individual notification display

### Sharing

- **ShareTodoModal**: Interface for sharing todos
- **SharedUsersList**: Display users with access to a todo

## Data Flow

### Creating a Todo

1. User submits TodoForm
2. Client-side validation occurs
3. API route `/api/todos` is called with todo data
4. Server validates request and user session
5. Prisma creates a new todo in the database
6. Response returns the created todo
7. Client updates UI state

### Sharing a Todo

1. User opens ShareTodoModal for a specific todo
2. User enters email and permission level
3. API route `/api/todos/[id]/share` is called
4. Server validates that the user owns the todo
5. Server checks if the target user exists
6. SharedTodo record is created in database
7. Notification is created for the target user
8. Response returns success
9. Modal updates to show the shared user

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: HTTP-only cookies for session storage
- **Password Security**: bcrypt for password hashing
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Next.js CSRF protection
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all API endpoints
- **Authorization Checks**: Multiple layers of permission verification
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks

## Performance Optimization

- **Static Generation**: Static pages where possible
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Dynamic pages with data requirements
- **Client-Side Data Fetching**: SWR for efficient data loading and caching
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Update UI before server response for better UX
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting through Next.js
- **Database Indexing**: Indexes on frequently queried fields

## Error Handling

- **Client-Side Validation**: Form validation before submission
- **API Error Responses**: Standardized error format
- **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries for UI error containment
- **Logging**: Error logging for debugging
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages for users

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: Testing component interactions
- **API Tests**: Testing API endpoints
- **End-to-End Tests**: Testing complete user flows

## Deployment Architecture

The application can be deployed in various environments:

### Vercel Deployment

- **Next.js App**: Hosted on Vercel's serverless platform
- **API Routes**: Deployed as serverless functions
- **Database**: External MySQL provider (e.g., PlanetScale)

### Docker Deployment

- **Next.js App**: Containerized application
- **Database**: MySQL container or external service
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose or Kubernetes

## Future Architectural Improvements

1. **Microservices**: Split the monolithic application into microservices
2. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSockets for real-time collaboration
3. **CQRS Pattern**: Separate command and query responsibilities
4. **Event Sourcing**: Record changes as a sequence of events
5. **GraphQL API**: Implement GraphQL for more flexible data fetching

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Branches**: Develop features in separate branches
2. **Pull Requests**: Code review before merging
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
4. **Semantic Versioning**: Clear version numbering
5. **Documentation**: Keep architecture documentation updated

## Conclusion

The Todo Application follows a modern, scalable architecture that balances simplicity with powerful features. Its component-based structure and clear separation of concerns make it maintainable and extensible for future enhancements.
